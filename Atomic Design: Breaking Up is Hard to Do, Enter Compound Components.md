# Atomic Design: Breaking Up is Hard to Do, Enter Compound Components!

If you've been around the frontend development scene for a while, you'd likely be familiar with Atomic Design. You know,
that slick, really systemized approach to building UI components to make everything feel and look modular, reusable, and
oh-so consistent. And it really does deliver on these expectations — at least in simpler projects where design and
interactions are rather straightforward.

But what happens when things get a little more complex? When your UI goes beyond being a mere collection of buttons and
input fields, becoming a dynamic, interactive system that must adapt and respond to users in ways that Atomic Design
likely didn't foresee? That is where the cracks start appearing.

In this article, we're going to dive into those cracks. We will get a closer look at the shortcomings of Atomic Design
for more complex and demanding UIs. But don't worry — we are not here to just highlight the problems. We'll also
introduce you to the Compound Components pattern, which is an even more flexible approach that might just be what you
need. By the end of this, at worst, you will realize how Compound Components can help you deal with state, handle
interactions, and keep your code as clean and scalable as possible — even when your UI is anything but simple.

## What Problem Does Atomic Design Try to Solve?

Before we get into where Atomic Design comes up short, let's take a step back and appreciate what it originally set out
to do. Without doubt, designs can quickly get messy. Components get reused in inconsistent ways, design systems often
end up more like loose guidelines than hard rules, and Atomic Design as conceived by Brad Frost was the silver bullet to
change all that. Basically, Atomic Design deals with creating consistency and modularity in your UI. It means breaking
the interface down to its very smallest building blocks, inspired by how matter is constructed in the real world. Just
like in chemistry, where atoms combine into molecules and those molecules come together to create organisms, atomic
design uses these terms for different levels of UI components. Atoms would be your basic, indestructible elements:
things such as buttons or input fields. Molecules would be groups of atoms and would be something like a form label
paired with an input field. Therefore, organisms would be more complex structures, like, for instance, a whole form with
multiple molecules performing together. This way, in thinking through every little piece of your UI, all the pieces will
be reusable and fit together predictably. While this is wonderful as a philosophy, UI design just doesn't always lend
itself to being that cut-and-dried in the real world. User interfaces more often call for flexibility, adaptability, and
dynamic interactions that don't normally fit within predefined categories. To this end, the very rigid structure of
atomic design sometimes tends to fall a little short at dealing with more subtle and complex demands made upon modern UI
development.

### The limits of Atomic Design

Atomic Design is a really nice starting point when looking to create consistent, modular UI components, but it's
definitely not perfect — especially when you need to cope with all the messy realities of modern web apps. The problem
here is it's a bit too rigid. On paper, the whole idea that atoms form molecules and molecules manifest as organisms is
nice, but when your UI needs to be flexible and responsive to real-world interactions, this strict hierarchy can start
to feel a bit like a straightjacket.

One of the biggest headaches has to do with state and dynamic behavior. UIs rarely exist in a static vacuum; they need
to be dynamic, responsive, and sometimes behave a little jig based on the whims of a user. Take for instance, a form.
How would an Atomic Design structure break this down? Well, it'd go: the form itself as an organism; the form fieldset
as molecules; and the individual input elements as atoms.

We start with a Input field

```tsx
// Atom: TextInput.tsx
import type { ChangeEvent } from 'react'

interface TextInputProps {
  value: string
  onChange: (e: ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => void
}

export function TextInput({ value, onChange }: TextInputProps) {
  return <input type="text" value={value} onChange={onChange} />
}
```

A Form field will render the Input field

```tsx
// Molecule: FormFields.tsx
import type { ChangeEvent, Dispatch, SetStateAction } from 'react'
import { TextInput } from './TextInput'

interface FormFieldsProps {
  formData: { name: string; email: string }
  setFormData: Dispatch<SetStateAction<{ name: string; email: string }>>
}

export function FormFields({ formData, setFormData }: FormFieldsProps) {
  return (
    <>
      <TextInput value={formData.name} onChange={(e) => setFormData({ ...formData, name: e.target.value })} />
      <TextInput value={formData.email} onChange={(e) => setFormData({ ...formData, email: e.target.value })} />
    </>
  )
}
```

And at the top level, we have the Form organism that renders the FormFields molecule and manages the form state

```tsx
// Organism: Form.tsx
import type { ChangeEvent, Dispatch, SetStateAction } from 'react'
import { FormFields } from './FormFields'

interface FormProps {
  formData: { name: string; email: string }
  setFormData: Dispatch<SetStateAction<{ name: string; email: string }>>
}

export function Form({ formData, setFormData }: FormProps) {
  return (
    <form>
      <FormFields formData={formData} setFormData={setFormData} />
      <button type="submit" disabled={!formData.name || !formData.email}>
        Submit
      </button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

But what if you need the form to validate input fields, display error messages, disable submittal until certain
conditions are met? It gets exhausting managing all these interactions across different layers. You find yourself having
state management scattered between the form molecule and the modal organism — exactly where tangled logic and a rigid
structure that is hard to maintain comes from.

The Input now gets an extra prop for the error

```tsx
// Atom: TextInput.tsx
import type { ChangeEvent } from 'react'

interface TextInputProps {
  value: string
  onChange: (e: ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => void
  error?: string
}

export function TextInput({ value, onChange }: TextInputProps) {
  return (
    <>
      <input type="text" value={value} onChange={onChange} />
      {error && <span className="error-message">{error}</span>}
    </>
  )
}
```

The FormFields molecule now maps this error object to the TextInput component

```tsx
// Molecule: FormFields.tsx
import type { ChangeEvent, Dispatch, SetStateAction } from 'react'
import { TextInput } from './TextInput'

interface FormFieldsProps {
  formData: { name: string; email: string }
  setFormData: Dispatch<SetStateAction<{ name: string; email: string }>>
  errors: { name?: string; email?: string }
}

export function FormFields({ formData, setFormData, errors }: FormFieldsProps) {
  return (
    <>
      <TextInput
        value={formData.name}
        onChange={(e) => setFormData({ ...formData, name: e.target.value })}
        errors={errors?.name}
      />
      <TextInput
        value={formData.email}
        onChange={(e) => setFormData({ ...formData, email: e.target.value })}
        errors={errors.email}
      />
    </>
  )
}
```

While the Form organism now has to manage the form validation logic

```tsx
// Organism: Form.tsx
import { type ChangeEvent, type Dispatch, type SetStateAction, useState } from 'react'
import { FormFields } from './FormFields'

interface FormProps {
  formData: { name: string; email: string }
  setFormData: Dispatch<SetStateAction<{ name: string; email: string }>>
}

export function Form({ formData, setFormData }: FormProps) {
  const [errors, setErrors] = useState<{ name?: string; email?: string }>({})

  const validate = () => {
    const newErrors: {
      name?: string
      email?: string
    } = {}

    if (!formData.name) {
      newErrors.name = 'Name is required'
    } else {
      delete newErrors.name
    }

    if (!formData.email) {
      newErrors.email = 'Email is required'
    } else {
      delete newErrors.email
    }

    setErrors(newErrors)
    return Object.keys(newErrors).length === 0
  }

  const handleSubmit = (e: FormEvent) => {
    e.preventDefault()
    const isValid = validate()
    if (isValid) {
      // submit form
    }
  }

  return (
    <form>
      <FormFields formData={formData} setFormData={setFormData} />
      <button type="submit" disabled={!formData.name || !formData.email}>
        Submit
      </button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

This undermines the very purpose of reusability and modularity that Atomic Design is supposed to serve with such changes
to a number of high-impact components in order to extend or adjust form behavior.

Then, there is the question of relationships between components. Your app's going to grow, and before you know it, you
realize that you are drowning in tones of repetitive code or, even worse, some overly complicated component hierarchies
that become a headache to handle. It doesn't stop there — managing different styles or variations of the same component
can add another layer of complexity. The places where atomic design can get overly rigid are in supporting multiple
themes, sizes, or interactive states; it's quite difficult to maintain consistency without repeating a lot of code or
convoluted overrides. The tight structure that Atomic Design provides gives you a very good framework to get started,
but sometimes boxes you in on things that really need to be flexible or adaptive for a project.

## Lessons from Atomic Design

Although atomic design has its shortcomings, it has endowed us with experience to move forward into other design
patterns. First and foremost, it brings out the importance of _structure and hierarchy_ in UI development. Breaking
interfaces down into smaller manageable components allows atomic design to help us think more systematically about how
to build and organize our UIs. This approach not only engenders consistency, but makes the codebase easier to comprehend
and maintain as a whole.

Another critical takeaway is _reusability_. Atomic Design advises us that elements should be created for many different
uses across different parts of an application. This is a fundamental principle of design systems: encouraging re-use of
components, removing duplication, and helping to keep consistency in the design throughout a project. While the tight
hierarchy that Atomic Design enforces doesn't work for more complex projects very often, the idea itself—making elements
which can be reused—remains at the heart of good UI design.

Finally, Atomic Design makes one realize the importance of _consistency_. Visual design, behavior, or the way components
are structured — it leads to a more intuitive and predictive user experience when it is consistent. While the very rigid
structure of Atomic Design might not work best in all scenarios, such key principles that it places its emphasis on are
things which can be applied to other, more flexible design patterns.

## Atomic Design vs Compound patterns, it is just an extension of atomic design

From my experience, Atomic Design proved to be an excellent basis for creating UI components. It is very robust because
it categorizes the elements on atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages. At the same time, this makes it easier
to construct consistent reusable components. However, as applications grow in complexity, the rigid nature of Atomic
Design can start to feel restrictive. That's where Compound Components come in — they take the foundation Atomic Design
provides and extend it to offer more flexibility and adaptability.

Compound Components, which are based on the Composite Pattern in software development, take the idea of grouping
individual objects into tree structures and apply it to frontend development. In this pattern, the parent component
plays a central role, managing shared state and logic, while child components handle specific tasks like rendering
content or handling user input. Think of this more like an orchestra, where the parent is the conductor and ensures
everything is in tune and all moving parts work together in harmony.

The main difference-and where Compound Components improve on Atomic Design-is in how they handle the relationships
between components. In Atomic Design, components are often defined as isolated pieces that fit into strict categories,
but Compound Components focus on how those pieces interact with each other. Instead of rigidly following predefined
levels, Compound Components let state and behavior flow naturally between parent and child components, giving you a much
more dynamic and flexible system.

So, while Compound Components won’t replace Atomic Design, it enhances it. It takes the strong foundation of structure
and consistency and layer in the flexibility needed to handle the growing complexity of modern web applications. It’s
about building a system that not only looks good on paper but also works smoothly in the real world.

### Getting to Know the Compound Pattern

The reason the Compound Pattern works so well in React is because it makes your components more flexible and easier to
manage. Because the parent component is managing state and business logic, the children can focus on their specific
roles without concern of how everything ties together. That simplifies things and moves you away from this commonly
experienced problem in React called "prop drilling", where you end up passing props through multiple layers of
components just to get data from one place to another.

Let’s break it down with a simple example in React using a Tabs component:
